## 📖 Executive Summary

The **Multi-Disease Prediction System** is a unified, intelligent healthcare web application that performs preliminary risk screening across five major chronic diseases using Classical Machine Learning pipelines:

1. ❤️ **Heart Disease** (Cardiovascular risk assessment from resting vitals, ECG, and stress test diagnostics)
2. 🫘 **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** (Renal filtration status from comprehensive urinalysis, blood chemistry, and comorbidities)
3. 🫀 **Liver Disease** (Hepatic impairment and biomarker profile from liver enzymes, bilirubin, and serum protein ratios)
4. 🫁 **Lung Disease** (Respiratory and cancer risk classification from lifestyle exposure and chronic symptomatic patterns)
5. 🎗️ **Breast Cancer** (Diagnostic malignancy classification from digitized Fine Needle Aspirate nuclear morphology)

Built using **Python 3.11**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Streamlit**, the application delivers instant risk stratification, model prediction confidence percentages, clinical guidance notes, and dynamic access to underlying model evaluation metrics.

## 📊 Machine Learning Models & Measured Benchmark Performance

All models were evaluated using an 80/20 stratified train-test split against 6 candidate algorithms (*Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting*). Preprocessing (scaling and imputation) is strictly encapsulated inside scikit-learn `Pipeline` objects to ensure zero data leakage.

| Disease Module | Selected Algorithm | Test Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC | Test Sample Size |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ❤️ **Heart Disease** | Logistic Regression | **85.25%** | 85.19% | 82.14% | **83.64%** | **0.9242** | 61 records |
| 🫘 **Kidney Disease (CKD)** | Random Forest Classifier | **100.00%** | 100.00% | 100.00% | **100.00%** | **1.0000** | 80 records |
| 🫀 **Liver Disease (ILPD)** | Logistic Regression | **73.50%** | 74.07% | 96.39% | **83.77%** | **0.8306** | 117 records |
| 🫁 **Lung Disease** | K-Nearest Neighbors | **89.29%** | 90.38% | 97.92% | **94.00%** | **0.9375** | 56 records |
| 🎗️ **Breast Cancer (WDBC)** | Support Vector Machine | **95.61%** | 97.44% | 90.48% | **93.83%** | **0.9828** | 114 records |

*Note on CKD:* Chronic Kidney Disease markers (e.g. serum creatinine, hemoglobin, albumin) provide strong separation in the UCI dataset, verified by 99.25% (±0.6%) 5-fold cross-validation.  
*Note on Lung Disease:* Evaluated on the deduplicated dataset of 276 unique patient responses to eliminate duplicate train-test contamination.
